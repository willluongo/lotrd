Legend of the Ruby Dragon
=========================

A text based RPG shamelessly inspired by an old doors game. It is ugly, but fun (both the coding and the game).

Objectives:
-----------

* Implement a game engine built around easily editable json files, to allow end users to customize their experience in game without a great deal of programming expertise
* Improve my ruby skills, as well as Ana's
* Improve my understanding of ruby idioms, to that end please feel free to ping me if you see ways to make it more "ruby-ish"
* Possibly at some point make it an actual multi-user game, like it used to be in ye olde BBS times... possibly browser based?

Installation:
-------------

For now, installation is as easy as cloning the repository, and running

	ruby LotRD.rb

You may (on older versions of ruby I believe) need to install the json gem:

	gem install json
